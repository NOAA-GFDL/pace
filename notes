MetricTerms: changes needed in initial calculations of grid lat/lon and cached properties 
	Best approach: modify functions called in ... is None branches?
	Side effects: important? how?

	Precompute at end of __init__
	side effects only used in metric terms class--for computing derived metric terms with better precision

Translation tests: how to run (want to use them as I go)

	pytest --data_path=... --which_modules=...(translate_grid.py) -vs fv3core/tests

Indexing: equivalent of i=isd,ied (how to get indexes from rank)

	Quantity: numpy arrays with properties that make them play nicely with gt4py
	.view: into compute domain of underlying data (no halos)
	.data: into full array (including halos)
	geometry.py -> edge_factors (get global indices using tile partitioner)
