# Standard Python environment on Daint

This repo contains the definition of the standard Python virtual environment
on Piz Daint.

Note: This repo is most probably of little general relevance if you are not working on the climate modeling team or on the Piz Daint supercomputer at CSCS in Switzerland. If you happen to want to use this repo for some purpose, it's probably best to reach out to someone on the climate modeling team to get help for achieving what you'd like to achieve.
