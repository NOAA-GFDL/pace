pace-util
===========

pace-util is a toolkit for building Python weather and climate models. Its features can seem disjoint, which is by design - you can choose which functionality you want to use and leave the rest. It is currently used to contain pure Python utilities shared by `fv3gfs-wrapper`_ and `fv3core`_. As the number of features increases, we may move its functionality into separate packages to reduce the dependency stack.

Some broad categories of features are:

- :py:class:`pace.util.Quantity`, the data type used by pace-util described in the section on :ref:`State`
- :ref:`Communication` objects used for MPI
- Utility functions useful in weather and climate models, described in :ref:`Utilities`
